/**
 * Landing hero — copy centred over a slow-scrolling row of the product's own
 * tiles, running off both edges of the screen.
 *
 * This replaces the browser-chrome mockup. A mockup is a picture of the app; the
 * showcase IS the app, rendered from demo data, so it can never fall out of date
 * with what the tiles actually look like.
 *
 * Spacing: 114px of air above the heading, 20px from subline to button, 55px
 * from button to the row, and a row window 32px taller than the tallest tile so
 * nothing is clipped.
 *
 * These numbers are OURS. An earlier version of this comment called them "the
 * measured original", which was not true — they appear in no reference
 * document, and the teardown's welcome page records 25px above its button and
 * 35px below. Claiming provenance for invented numbers is worse than inventing
 * them, because it stops anyone checking. They are kept because this page was
 * signed off as it stands, not because they were measured.
 *
 * The two CTAs mirror the marketing header: a ghost "Demo" button and an
 * outline "Get started" button. This keeps the entry points consistent across
 * the chrome and the hero.
